This document serves as a checklist to ensure key security measures have been implemented and reviewed.

**Review Date**: 2025-08-26
**Reviewed By**: Jules (AI Engineer)
**Status**: ✅ Initial Implementation Complete

---

## Authentication & Authorization
- [x] JWT tokens are used and validated correctly via `passport-jwt`.
- [x] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented using a `RolesGuard`.
- [x] Sensitive endpoints are protected with `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)`.
- [x] MFA (TOTP) support is implemented for enhancing account security.
- [x] OAuth integration flow is defined (mocked implementation).
- [x] Session management logic is planned (placeholder service exists).

## Data Protection
- [x] Passwords are not stored in plaintext; they are hashed using `bcrypt`.
- [x] Sensitive data (e.g., PII) is identified, with placeholder encryption service created.
- [x] Input validation is used on all DTOs via `class-validator`.
- [x] TypeORM is used, which mitigates SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## API Security
- [x] Global rate limiting is implemented with `nestjs-throttler` to prevent abuse.
- [x] API documentation (Swagger) does not expose sensitive internal details.
- [x] Error messages are generic and do not leak implementation details (e.g., "Invalid credentials" instead of "User not found").

## Infrastructure Security
- [x] Secrets (DB password, JWT secret) are managed via environment variables, not hardcoded.
- [x] The multi-stage `Dockerfile` uses a lean `node-alpine` image for the final stage to reduce surface area.
- [x] The application does not require root privileges to run.

## Compliance
- [x] Placeholder endpoints for GDPR/152-ФЗ data export and deletion requests are implemented.
- [x] Consent management is planned (mock endpoint exists).
- [x] A full audit trail is implemented via the `AuditInterceptor` and `audit_log` table.
