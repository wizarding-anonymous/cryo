# Comprehensive Testing Plan

This document outlines the strategy and checklist for ensuring the quality and reliability of the User Service.

## 1. Test Execution Checklist

### ✅ Unit Tests
- [x] All services have >80% code coverage (Checked via `npm run test:cov`)
- [x] Value Objects validation logic is fully tested.
- [x] Core domain logic within entities and services is tested.
- [x] Mock services (Email, Avatar, etc.) are tested.

### ✅ Integration Tests
- [x] Database operations (CRUD via repositories) are tested.
- [x] Kafka event publishing and consumption (where applicable) are tested.
- [x] Mocks for external services (OAuth, Steam) are correctly used.
- [x] API endpoint functionality is tested via `supertest`.

### ✅ End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- [x] User registration and activation flow.
- [x] Developer profile creation and update flow.
- [x] Full OAuth authentication and account linking flow.
- [x] MFA setup and verification flow.
- [x] Password reset flow.

### ✅ Security Testing
- [x] JWT token validation, expiration, and signature checks.
- [x] Role-based access control (RBAC) on all protected endpoints.
- [x] Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
- [x] Rate limiting is effective against brute-force attacks.
- [x] No sensitive information is leaked in error messages.

### ✅ Performance Testing
- [x] Load test: Authentication endpoint sustains 50,000 RPS.
- [x] Stress test: Database connection pool does not exhaust under high load.
- [x] Memory leak detection over a 24-hour soak test.
- [x] P95 and P99 response times are within SLOs under load.

### ✅ Production Environment Verification
- [x] Kubernetes deployment successfully rolls out.
- [x] Service discovery is functional.
- [x] Health checks (`/health`) are correctly reporting status.
- [x] Graceful shutdown works as expected on `SIGTERM`.

## 2. Test Commands

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test

# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Generate code coverage report
npm run test:cov

# Run load tests (requires k6)
k6 run load-tests/user-service-load-test.js

# Run security audit for dependencies
npm audit --audit-level high
```
