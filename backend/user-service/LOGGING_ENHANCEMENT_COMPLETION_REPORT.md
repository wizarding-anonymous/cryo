### Log Structure
```json
{
  "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "info",
  "message": "User operation completed successfully",
  "service": "user-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "correlationId": "abc123-def456-ghi789",
  "userId": "user-uuid-here",
  "operation": "user_create",
  "duration": 150,
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "metadata": { "success": true },
  "host": "user-service-pod-1",
  "pid": 1234
}
