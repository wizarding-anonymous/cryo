# Docker Compose vs Kubernetes Deployment Options

## Overview

This document describes the available deployment options for the Library Service: Docker Compose and Kubernetes. Both deployment methods are maintained and serve different use cases.

## Deployment Options

### Docker Compose Files (Maintained):
- `docker-compose.yml` - Development environment
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development with additional services
- `docker-compose.test.yml` - Testing environment
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production Docker Compose configuration
- `docker-compose.production.yml` - Alternative production configuration

### Kubernetes Manifests (New):
- `k8s/deployment.yaml` - Application deployment
- `k8s/service.yaml` - Service configuration
- `k8s/configmap.yaml` - Configuration management
- `k8s/secret.yaml` - Secrets management
- `k8s/pvc.yaml` - Persistent storage
- `k8s/hpa.yaml` - Auto-scaling
- `k8s/networkpolicy.yaml` - Network security
- `k8s/serviceaccount.yaml` - RBAC configuration

## When to Use Each Option

### Use Docker Compose When:
- 🏠 **Local Development** - Quick setup and testing
- 🔧 **Simple Deployments** - Single server deployments
- 🚀 **Rapid Prototyping** - Fast iteration and testing
- 📚 **Learning/Training** - Easier to understand and debug
- 💰 **Cost-Effective** - Smaller infrastructure requirements

### Use Kubernetes When:
- 🏢 **Production Environments** - Enterprise-grade deployments
- 📈 **High Scalability** - Need for auto-scaling and load balancing
- 🔒 **Enhanced Security** - RBAC, network policies, pod security
- 🌐 **Multi-Environment** - Dev/staging/prod with different configurations
- 🔄 **CI/CD Integration** - Advanced deployment strategies
- 📊 **Advanced Monitoring** - Integration with cloud-native monitoring stacks

## Kubernetes Advantages:
1. **Better Scalability** - HPA with CPU/Memory metrics
2. **Enhanced Security** - RBAC, Network Policies, Pod Security
3. **Improved Reliability** - Pod Disruption Budgets, Health Checks
4. **Resource Management** - Resource limits and requests
5. **Service Discovery** - Native Kubernetes DNS
6. **Rolling Updates** - Zero-downtime deployments
7. **Environment Isolation** - Namespace-based separation

### Features Migrated:
- ✅ Application deployment with health checks
- ✅ PostgreSQL persistent storage
- ✅ Redis caching
- ✅ Auto-scaling (2-10 replicas)
- ✅ Resource limits and requests
- ✅ Security policies
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Secrets management
- ✅ Monitoring integration (Prometheus)
- ✅ Network isolation

## Deployment Comparison

### Docker Compose (Old):
```bash
# Development
docker-compose up -d

# Production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Kubernetes (New):
```bash
# Development
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/dev/

# Production
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/prod/

# Or base deployment
kubectl apply -k k8s/
```

## Configuration Changes

### Environment Variables:
- Most environment variables remain the same
- Secrets are now managed via Kubernetes Secrets
- Configuration split between ConfigMap (non-sensitive) and Secret (sensitive)

### Storage:
- Docker volumes → Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaims
- Better storage class support
- Automatic volume provisioning

### Networking:
- Docker bridge networks → Kubernetes Services + NetworkPolicies
- Better service discovery
- Enhanced security with network isolation

## Choosing the Right Option

### For Development Teams:
```bash
# Quick local development
docker-compose up -d

# Local development with full stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### For Production Deployments:

#### Option 1: Docker Compose (Simpler)
```bash
# Single server production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

#### Option 2: Kubernetes (Scalable)
```bash
# Development environment
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/dev/

# Production environment
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/prod/
```

## Migration Path

Teams can gradually migrate from Docker Compose to Kubernetes:

1. **Phase 1**: Start with Docker Compose for development
2. **Phase 2**: Use Docker Compose for initial production deployments
3. **Phase 3**: Migrate to Kubernetes when scaling requirements grow
4. **Phase 4**: Use Kubernetes for all environments with proper CI/CD

## Maintenance

Both deployment methods are actively maintained:
- ✅ Docker Compose files - Updated for development and simple production use
- ✅ Kubernetes manifests - Updated for scalable production deployments
- ✅ Documentation - Kept current for both approaches
