## üîç Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Service Availability**
   - Uptime percentage
   - Health check status
   - Service restart frequency

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time percentiles (50th, 95th, 99th)
   - Request rate (requests per minute)
   - Error rate percentage
   - Throughput metrics

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - Memory usage (heap used/total)
   - CPU usage percentage
   - Event loop lag
   - Garbage collection metrics

4. **Database Performance**
   - Connection pool utilization
   - Query execution time
   - Slow query count
   - Database error rate

5. **Business Metrics**
   - Library operations per minute
   - Search operations per minute
   - Cache hit rate
   - External service call success rate

### Alert Thresholds

| Metric | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Response Time (95th) | >1000ms | >5000ms |
| Error Rate | >1% | >5% |
| Memory Usage | >85% | >95% |
| CPU Usage | >80% | >90% |
| DB Connections | >15 | >18 |
| Cache Hit Rate | <70% | <50% |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Memory Usage**
   - Check for memory leaks in application code
   - Verify garbage collection is working properly
   - Consider increasing heap size or optimizing queries

2. **Slow Response Times**
   - Check database query performance
   - Verify cache hit rates
   - Monitor external service response times
   - Check for blocking operations

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify connection pool configuration
   - Check database server health
   - Monitor connection leak patterns
   - Verify network connectivity

4. **Cache Performance Issues**
   - Check Redis server health
   - Verify cache key patterns
   - Monitor cache eviction rates
   - Optimize TTL values

### Log Analysis

**Important Log Patterns to Monitor**:
- `ERROR` level logs for application errors
- `WARN` level logs for performance issues
- Security events in structured logs
- Business events for operational insights
- External service call failures

**Log Locations**:
- Application logs: `logs/library-service.log`
- Error logs: `logs/library-service-error.log`
- Performance logs: `logs/library-service-performance.log`

## üìö Runbooks

### Service Restart
```bash
# Graceful restart
npm run prod:start

# Check health after restart
npm run prod:health
```

### Emergency Shutdown
```bash
# Send SIGTERM for graceful shutdown
kill -TERM <pid>

# Force shutdown if needed (after 30s timeout)
kill -KILL <pid>
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# View recent logs
npm run prod:logs

# View error logs
npm run prod:logs:error

# Search for specific patterns
grep "ERROR" logs/library-service.log | tail -20
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
# Get current metrics
npm run prod:metrics

# Check health status
curl http://localhost:3000/health/detailed
```

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Daily**
   - Monitor key metrics and alerts
   - Check error logs for new issues
   - Verify backup completion

2. **Weekly**
   - Review performance trends
   - Analyze slow query reports
   - Update security patches

3. **Monthly**
   - Review and optimize database indexes
   - Analyze cache performance patterns
   - Update monitoring thresholds
   - Review and rotate logs

### Scaling Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Service is stateless and can be scaled horizontally
- **Database Scaling**: Consider read replicas for high read loads
- **Cache Scaling**: Redis can be clustered for high availability
- **Load Balancing**: Use proper load balancer configuration for multiple instances
