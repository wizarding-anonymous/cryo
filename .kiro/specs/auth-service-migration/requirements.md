# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for migrating authentication functionality from User Service to Auth Service, ensuring complete separation of concerns and proper microservice integration. The goal is to create a dedicated authentication microservice that handles all authentication-related operations while User Service focuses solely on user data management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Authentication Migration

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all authentication functionality moved from User Service to Auth Service, so that each service has a single responsibility and the system follows microservice best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN Auth Service SHALL handle all user registration operations
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN Auth Service SHALL handle all user login operations  
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN Auth Service SHALL handle all user logout operations
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN Auth Service SHALL handle all JWT token generation and validation
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN Auth Service SHALL handle all password hashing and verification
6. WHEN the migration is complete THEN User Service SHALL NOT contain any authentication-related endpoints
7. WHEN the migration is complete THEN User Service SHALL NOT contain any authentication-related business logic
8. WHEN the migration is complete THEN User Service SHALL NOT contain any JWT-related functionality

### Requirement 2: Service Integration and Communication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Auth Service to integrate seamlessly with User Service for user data operations, so that authentication works correctly without duplicating user management logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Auth Service needs to create a user THEN it SHALL call User Service's user creation endpoint
2. WHEN Auth Service needs to verify user existence THEN it SHALL call User Service's user lookup endpoints
3. WHEN Auth Service successfully authenticates a user THEN it SHALL call User Service to update last login timestamp
4. WHEN Auth Service validates a token THEN it SHALL verify user existence through User Service
5. IF User Service is unavailable THEN Auth Service SHALL handle the failure gracefully
6. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use HTTP REST APIs with proper error handling
7. WHEN Auth Service calls User Service THEN it SHALL pass already-hashed passwords for user creation

### Requirement 3: User Service API Endpoints for Auth Integration

**User Story:** As an Auth Service, I want User Service to provide specific endpoints for user management, so that I can perform necessary user operations without exposing authentication logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Auth Service needs to create a user THEN User Service SHALL provide POST /users endpoint
2. WHEN Auth Service needs to find user by email THEN User Service SHALL provide GET /users/email/:email endpoint
3. WHEN Auth Service needs to find user by ID THEN User Service SHALL provide GET /users/:id endpoint
4. WHEN Auth Service needs to update last login THEN User Service SHALL provide PATCH /users/:id/last-login endpoint
5. WHEN Auth Service needs to check user existence THEN User Service SHALL provide GET /users/:id/exists endpoint
6. WHEN User Service receives user creation request THEN it SHALL accept pre-hashed passwords
7. WHEN User Service endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 4: Authentication Security Features

5. WHEN a user logs out THEN Auth Service SHALL blacklist the JWT token in Redis
6. WHEN validating tokens THEN Auth Service SHALL check token blacklist status
7. WHEN password validation occurs THEN Auth Service SHALL enforce strong password requirements
8. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN Auth Service SHALL implement throttling for auth endpoints

### Requirement 5: Token Management and Validation

**User Story:** As other microservices, I want Auth Service to provide token validation services, so that I can verify user authentication without implementing JWT logic myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN other services need token validation THEN Auth Service SHALL provide POST /auth/validate endpoint
2. WHEN validating tokens THEN Auth Service SHALL verify JWT signature and expiration
3. WHEN validating tokens THEN Auth Service SHALL check if token is blacklisted
4. WHEN validating tokens THEN Auth Service SHALL verify user still exists and is not deleted
5. WHEN token validation succeeds THEN Auth Service SHALL return user information
6. WHEN token validation fails THEN Auth Service SHALL return appropriate error response
7. WHEN refresh token is provided THEN Auth Service SHALL generate new access token
8. WHEN refresh token is invalid THEN Auth Service SHALL reject the request

### Requirement 6: External Service Integrations

**User Story:** As Auth Service, I want to integrate with other platform services for comprehensive functionality, so that authentication events are properly logged and users receive appropriate notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user registration occurs THEN Auth Service SHALL log security event to Security Service
2. WHEN user login occurs THEN Auth Service SHALL log security event to Security Service  
3. WHEN user logout occurs THEN Auth Service SHALL log security event to Security Service
4. WHEN user registration is successful THEN Auth Service SHALL send welcome notification via Notification Service
5. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN Auth Service SHALL send security alert via Notification Service
6. IF external services are unavailable THEN Auth Service SHALL continue operation without failing
7. WHEN calling external services THEN Auth Service SHALL implement proper timeout and retry logic

### Requirement 7: Data Migration and Cleanup

3. WHEN migration starts THEN all JWT-related dependencies SHALL be removed from User Service
4. WHEN migration starts THEN User Service app.module SHALL be updated to remove AuthModule
5. WHEN migration completes THEN User Service SHALL only handle user data CRUD operations
6. WHEN migration completes THEN existing user data SHALL remain intact and accessible
7. WHEN migration completes THEN User entity SHALL include lastLoginAt field for Auth Service integration

### Requirement 8: API Documentation and Testing
